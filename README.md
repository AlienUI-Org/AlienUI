## Getting started

There is no AlienUI installation, if you have a bare React Native project setup with NativeWind, you can copy the code and paste it into your project. React Native in-built Stylesheet Api is also supported if you do not wish to use NativeWind.

## Usage

Browse the website for the components you need, copy the code and paste it into your project. Some components will have support TypeScript.
